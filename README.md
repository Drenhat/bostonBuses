# Real Time Bus Tracker
an app that is showing the current position of Boston buses
## Description
> This project is showing the current position of Boston buses. It uses the API mapbox and is programmed to show the city of Boston. If you press the button at the top left, the project will show markers. These markers show the position of the different buses circulating inside Boston. The most challgenging part was to create a function that create a marker for each of the buses.
## How to run
> To run the project, load the index file. A map of Boston will appear. To track the buses, press the button at the top left.
## Roadmap of future improvements
> The markers are not currently showing which buses they are refering to. It would be an interesting improvement to make it visible on the map.
## License information: 
> The code is an improvement from an MIT xPro exercise
